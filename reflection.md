Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    Inheritance really same me a lot of time to code the same thing over and over again. 
    Inheritance also shows the connection of each file/class we are working on. It makes us easier to create a tree graph in our mind about what each class takes charge of/what function each class have or can have.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    For me, I am still not very familiar with how exceptions work in coding, but for now I feel I figure it out.
    Also, I feel the logic for methods specially designed for each of the classes is a little more challenging than what we have in previous assignments. I need to work more on logic instead of simplifying code.
